For CMSC 100, I expect to learn a great deal about web programming. I expect that some topics might be challenging and hard to grasp but will be very useful in the long run. I also expect that every lesson and requirement will be interesting and helpful to everyone's programming journey. 

Hi! I agree with your expectations for CMSC 100 ^^
